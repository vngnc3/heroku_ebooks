the reason i could easily pull 1000+ online friends to a private matchmaking server is due to the fact that matchmaking is so much harder than friends. you need to be 'in the know' about what's going on in the scene to be a friend. i'm talking about the scene as a collection of people you could easily know in person.

in conclusion: yes, a lot of animator in my generation are like "oh i grew up watching cartoons with my parents and grandparents, so it's safe for me to say that CG is not that bad." and this is exactly the point: it's comforting. it's familiar. it's familiar to many people. it's familiar to me. so i guess it makes sense that i would gravitate towards it.

====================
i'm still in the process of figuring out what exactly is wrong with me. i still have my best interests at heart, my career, and my home at heart. but lately i feel like my interests are more important than my career and home at heart.

i'm still in the process of figuring out exactly how to go about certifying a service as a service. there are plenty of open source services that can be trusted as a service, but ultimately it comes down to you and your organization to decide if this is something that you'd want to put your trust in or not.
====================
in conclusion: i'd absolutely use this render for something quick and dirty like previz, last-minute VJ loop rendering, uploading to twitter/ig, etc. for better details and output, i'd stick to using my fast preset although it's not near realtime like this one.

i'm still in the process of learning how to make 3D assets in blender and stuff. still learning how to work with modeling software though 👌
====================
i mean, it's pretty much a self-imposed exile from the real world for a limited amount of time. but the real world doesn't last forever. it just tapers off after a while. so, i guess it wouldn't be too bad if i just sit back and watch some anime and games on Netflix and Youtube. i mean, it's relaxing, and i'm still supposed to be working. but then again, i could just play games or watch anime all day.

all jokes aside, real life friend and fellow student ratio teacher, and scholar, is much higher quality than the works of shallow content creators.

i know i am biased, but i have this feeling that content creators in indo are more likely to be self-aware and self-aware of their content / audience ratio.

or at least, they would be more likely to think twice before using this kind of ratio in their coursework.

it's a little disheartening but it's the truth. my whole life was built on the expectation that the world would revolve around the idea that technology is good. the expectation that humanity is capable of amazing things.

yet humanity still faces obstacles every day.

our bodies aren't built to handle it.
our minds are built on a daily cycle of fear, violence, and competition.

it's not so much about the money itself, but rather the way society treats people who are financially dependent on it.

it's there to help you conceptualize money (and scarcity) when you're stuck in a linear story (or worse, an unsupervised one)
|elsewhere on twitter, you'll find a lot of fob's description sounds exactly like my fob.
i think it might be semantic - i'm not saying it's not grammatical. but i can definitely say that i'm not looking for opinions or being biased towards one particular opinion.

i would love to talk about how good XCOM: Enemy Unknown is (or at least how good my first impression of the game is) but my brain is in a zen cycle where it's 11pm in shijuku and my mood is kinda fuzzy sometimes. i think i'm gonna have to cycle back on and on and on.

well shit i finally got a new blender . and yes, it is a re-branded Imaginary Mark. re-branded because of their appearance on Netflix's most recent episode of House of Cards. re-branded because of how good the controls are and how easy it is to use them. it feels so good to be back after a few weeks break 🙃

i still apply for and get rejected many shit like this every year but this year i actually got it. it was so hard but it finally happened. i'm not going to lie it felt good to finally get a valid IB number after years of searching and rejection. let's just say it wasn't easy.

i will be honest and say that i am not qualified to speak on the importance of race/religious/ethnic studies in today's world. my background is in mechanical engineering and computer vision. i am also a self-taught artist who thrives on sharing his/her art with others. however, i have witnessed first-hand how important these subjects are to many people and it really drove home how important they are to me.

- there's still an opportunity for u to rectify the situation by voting to remove all references to menstruation/menstruation option from future DASH releases.
- or better yet, voting to add a menstruation/menstruation sub-category to the main DASH product page.
- or at least, being shown that it's an option.
- and this sub-category should be accessible only to registered users of Dash.
- not the product itself.

i will say this about nvidia control panel : it's there to make the controls easier for the less tech-savvy user. not because of the technical aspects, but the user experience. it doesn't matter if you're new to blender, or using OctaneRender, you'll probably feel intimidated by the sheer amount of options and ways to tweak the rendering and object placement.

don't put your expectations on how something that can only be described as 'psychographic profile' can be 'good'. the description could be 100% accurate, but the actual thing could be 100% bad. i know, seeing the despair in people's eyes when they saw my sadistic tendencies, and the truth that i have always been eternally sadistic towards animals. i cannot help it. i am a failure as a creator.

i have a confession to make: i am a huge Doctor Who fan. 

ever since the show first debuted 30 years ago, i was hooked from the very first episode.

7:00 PM, Monday, November 27th
we're going back to work!
if you've been paying attention, you'd know that i like to work from home because it's relatively quiet, and relatively unfenced of electronic music. 
i feel like pouring myself a shot of scotch and leave the office to spend time with my art and music collection.
====================
why on earth would any sane human being want to tamper with the computer model of the human brain? we are capable of so much more than just rational calculations. our creativity lies in the infinite possibilities presented by our mind.

some of us might not be able to see the forest for the trees.

some of us might not be able to smell the forest for the woods.

and some of us might not be able to talk to the forest for the forest.

i know this is not a realistic representation of the forest, and it might even be limiting our experience.
but i wanted to create something that feels more like a nature documentary or documentaries on documentaries.
something that might be of interest to a casual reader of twitter/instagram/youtube/Tumblr.

i'm sorry to say this, but back in the day, photography was a medium not a mode. you could make any kind of image you wanted, and it would be accepted in many mediums and modes.

a few weeks ago, my production assistant Rachael just submitted a bug report about how Outlook on PC won't open in wavelet rendering on mobile devices.

glad you two decided to stop working together on instagram and twitter. 

i'm still in love with your work.
but also, i think you two should've known each other better.
let's say it's 10 years and you two are still alive. 
how would you two react if i told you that i'd be opening a new twitter/instagram account with a completely different structure and content?
i'm thinking karyakarsa, triarch, or something similar.
i'm still positive about instagram and the way it was set up.
but i think i'd be open to hearing your feedback and ideas about how things could be better.
i'd be open to seeing your work and talking about it with your audience if you two are both in agreement.
🖤
i'd still operate under the same rules and guidelines as usual.
(which is why it'll be completely different from normal instagram).

nftBunny loves complaining and moaning about how free software doesn't guarantee you privacy because technically, your phone can be traced back to the manufacturer and the person selling the phone. this is a massive problem with crypto, where you can be "tricked" into thinking that your phone is the product of a random manufacturer and "advertiser". this is a problem that was created by the surveillance state and/or Big Brother.

neuralink neurallink is the only library for C4D that can output images as 2D images. this is a big deal because normally when you have multiple CPU threads working on the same image processing it would take more CPU cycles to render the same pixel pattern. this is because each CPU thread needs to render the diffuse, specular, and edge detail separately.

its a stupid question imo. i mean, sure you could argue that films such as hers (or anything by this author) are less realistic and less relatable to the average joe or even the average person, but i think it would be apples and oranges.

few years ago, i decided to re-think and revise some of my opinions on cinema.

i'm glad i did.

i still think a lot of celluloid animation in cinema are bad, but i'm starting to see that they're beginning to change.
remember, in my opinion, cinema is not representative of the majority.
its just my opinion.
you can disagree, but you should know that imo, celluloid animation is much less representative of the people who actually go to the cinema or people who are familiar with cinema.

<|startoftext|>yes you totally should. i mean seriously, you have to see this movie to believe it.

it is definitely one of the most important war stories of our generation.
it is also one of the most relatable ones.
i've had the privilege of interviewing people about their childhood and some will tell you that their childhood was very similar to mine.
(this is a biased sample since i'm talking about an actual person, not an imagined one)

i have always believed that people can grow and change just like i have.
and this is one of the things that drew me to see war stories about war-torn countries in the first place.
not stories of war that is still stable and prosperous.

especially with regards to procedural generation and organic generation.

why would anyone who profits from exploitation and oppression give a damn about the plight of others?

well if they're financially motivated to do so, they should be 100% behind the plight of others.

if they're not 100% behind the plight of others, then they're complicit.

i know, this might sound harsh.
but i honestly believe this:
the only way to truly fight exploitation is to fight for others in an ethical manner.
to demand that your government NOT steal from you when you have the power to demand that their actions be in accordance with your moral code.

This is a very special edition of our set to be released each week. This week we have a new track, the joy. This time around we're releasing a new collage and a whole new aspect of the app. The app is only available in collage format now, instead of the traditional image and video. The app is still available in its regular LP and JUN version, but we're including the special edition JUN edition with the collage and video.

__&gt; It's 3AM in the morning. You're tired of all these YouTube stars and podcasts. You've tried hosting your own radio show, writing posts for dicussion, composing music, etc. You finally get it: this is where you should start.

__&gt; How?__

it's been a pleasure bringing you these tweets. 

🙏🏾👌🥽🙏🏾
====================
the first time i saw the graswald pixar film "Bakal" was during my first visit to cineplex. i had never seen a live action puppet act before and boy oh boy is this movie a live action puppet act. they have so many and they are totally in character. the more i thought about it, the more i like it and the more i want to see more of their work.

so imagine my delight when i saw their new music video for their track "Nothing to Hold".
yep, this is exactly why i'm glad that they're expanding their video content with live music in future.
====================
they'd probably lose their minds if they actually see what i make
====================
ipso facto, twitter should have a better block button. it's such an important part of how we communicate on the platform.
====================
i'm serious
====================
only thing holding me back from writing something like this is the fact that i still have a lot of work to do. but hey, it's a sign that i'm moving forward! 🖤

i fucking hate it when clients treat my stream like a live recording when it's just a small chat with a few friends.
====================
i fucking hate it when i'm in a rush and my brain farts all over my work-related documents

====================
but i know a lot of film and tv industry people just love to talk shit and brag about how successful they were in the film industry. so i put this here for posterity only. not to brag or talk shit about my experience in the film industry. i just wanna make sure everyone knows that there's plenty of film and tv industry people out there who can tell you that you could be successful even if you're not part of the film or tv industry.
====================
i'm still on the fence about harum scarum. it's an original composition by mihoy tua and it's probably the most interesting music video I've ever seen in my entire life.
====================
only 1,000 seats left to be sold out.
😭😭😭
====================
in conclusion: my feeble attempt at building AI with R seems to be working perfectly.
====================
those who want to be 'normal' should understand that 'normal' is relative. no one is 'normal' just because they're 'in the right place'. that's why i would put so much effort into learning about 'normality' in the first place.
====================
this newfangled music video looks like it was made in 5 minutes. standby for 5 minutes.
====================
spoiler alert: this article contains a list of games that were developed and released between 2002 and 2018. there's a reason why some games are on PS3 and PS4, while others are only available on iOS. games are on the market because consumers want to play games with cool graphics and gameplay, not because publishers want to sell more PS+ and PSN membership.
====================
it may be tempting to say that pandemic is better than yakuza because "it's pandemic" and "they're the baddest bunch of bikin I've ever met". however, this is exactly what they were trying to do with 999 and their sequel Black Market. so watch out for the B.M.K. virus, not the K.M.K. virus. GOT

i feel like injecting myself with this season 5 finale of Silicon Valley 👀

i like how ind0 govt doesn't have gun control
====================
but i should probably start a new sepiiiiiiiiight thread just for this purpose. i'll post the found photos and videos in this thread. and maybe a voice mail from udahR who knows udahR better than anyone.
====================
all of these yakuza films are set in different time periods and different worlds. the only thing that ties them all is the fictional setting and setting of the MCU. i want to make a film that will not only feel true to the real life of a certain group of people, but one that will also evoke an emotional response from the audience.

i'm not talking about fitness trackers or blood glucose monitors, i'm talking specifically about the invasive and over-the-air software that is embedded in smart meters. these things are making smart meters more invasive and power hungry than ever.

Did anyone ever tell you that money can't buy happiness?

Not if you're creating something that's meaningful to others.

If you're merely a collection of bits and bytes on a computer, it could very well be that you're creating something that's more meaningful to others.
just a reminder : venomnya is an unique kind of poison that has no medicinal value - it's a neurotoxin and evolutionarily it makes no sense as a kind of natural selection pressure - more efficient evolutionary pressure.
====================
i'm proud that i'm able to say it's "our generation's generation" when we're all of one

the same generation that helped make the modern world possible

are you kidding me bro? u know what, i'm gonna use this platform to my advantage by showing people around the web about how free and open source software really is. i can sell my personal information as long as it's not being sold for commercial gain.

btw, this is the kind of thing we expect of twitter/insta celebs. but never actually seeing it, hearing about it, and reading the description. it doesn't sound like it was an easy thing for her to do. it must have been a very difficult thing for him to do. both in writing and performance.
